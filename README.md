# atv-client (very dummy implementation)
AppleTV client written in Node.js

Pairing, Verification and other routines are mainly take from those guys:
- https://github.com/postlund/pyatv (Python implementation)
- https://github.com/funtax/AirPlayAuth (Java example about authentication)

Good job guys!

# TODO

- Make an http server with basic authentication to simplify apple routine
- Refactor code a bit to make public API prettier
